**LeetCode Problem #1 (Easy)** <br />

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.<br />

May assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and may not use the same element twice.<br />

Can return the answer in any order.<br />

**Constraints:**<br />
2 <= nums.length <= 10^4 <br />
-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9 <br />
-10^9 <= target <= 10^9 <br />

My solution runs in O(n) Time & Space Complexity. <br />
Better than running in O(n^2) Time & Space Complexity with a nested for loop. <br />
